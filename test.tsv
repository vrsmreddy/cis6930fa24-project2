     1	Would you like to know why French and Italians love/hate each others? Would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime? So, go to watch Virzi's film (in original language, of course) and you can look at a wonderful Monica Bellucci who finally speaks her native language from Città di Castello (Umbria, just at the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters speaking Livornese (lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel ███████ definitely in his shoes with Napoleon. A lot of fun, a real fresco of the Elba Island landscape, and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant (good for all times).
     2	But he must get past the princes and █████ first.
     3	The Fury of the Wolfman is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Paul Naschy/Jacinto Molina, Perla Cristal, Verónica Luján, ████████████, Francisco Amorós, Fabián Conde, Miguel de la Riva, Ramón Lillo, José Marco, Javier de Rivera, and Pilar Zorrilla!
     4	His wife, scheming ██████████████, longs for the finer things in life.
     5	Three of the things you can say about █████████████ are: he certainly marched to the beat of his own "drummer;" he was never at a loss for words; and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial at times.
     6	This film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movies that abound. It is about real people making the best of their lives. They just happen to be Indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. The realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot. The sound track is by BC Smith, who also did the soundtrack for ████████████, and is great. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and Wes Studi is the stoic consummately professional detective. There are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. We have also seen Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we greatly enjoyed it too.
     7	Talented screenwriter █████████████ sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite mom's flighty behavior.
     8	███████ also gets across his feeling of foreboding and the sense its all building up to something.
     9	██████ and Murphy simply had fun making this movie, so should we (watching it)
    10	Very nice camera work by ████████████████ and the wonderful "Albatross" by Fleetwood Mac at the end.
    11	The rest of the cast, which includes ████████████ is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff.
    12	███████████ Walken is very catlike, and doesn't need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human.
    13	Based on ██████████████ Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.
    14	There are far too many bad things about this movie for Mr. ████ to get any credit.
    15	Would you like to know why French and Italians love/hate each others? Would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime? So, go to watch Virzi's film (in original language, of course) and you can look at a wonderful ███████████████ who finally speaks her native language from Città di Castello (Umbria, just at the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters speaking Livornese (lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel Auteuil definitely in his shoes with Napoleon. A lot of fun, a real fresco of the Elba Island landscape, and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant (good for all times).
    16	██████ acts as the alter ego of the real director.
    17	Rather than send them to a Catholic school, she decides to up and leave for Belfast, then Scotland, where a few more cliches are reguritated While she's there, her father (who looks eerily like ████████████) and family back home are subjected to a boycott, which turns very nasty
    18	██████ plays an obsessive sort, which is why his younger brothers find it grueling to be in his company, which tugs the easygoing movie along.
    19	John Carpenter uses ██████████████ as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia.
    20	And yes, it does feature ████████████ albeit a little too fleetingly.
    21	██████████████ is a hack, avoid or burn.
    22	Neo-realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather (along with ███████'s The Children Are Watching Us), which that would take shape after the war.
    23	Then a reporter, ███████████████, investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying.
    24	I came across this movie on TV, the story of the struggle of the Burmese people against a military dictatorship was provoking, the story of ████████████ was a good thread to hold the story of political struggle together.
    25	It might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but I found ████████████ voice to be irritating beyond belief .
    26	█████ is now a fully fledged assassin, meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion unfortunately, now the character is instilled with a sort of Man With No Name style mysteriousness, Ueto's model looks become even more inappropriate.
    27	At nightfall, ████ and other women search with torches for survivors
    28	This documentary is such a wonderful example of what an entertaining and amazing experience a documentary can be, if done so well as this The subject, ████, is smart, funny and very driven, and this story of his personal fight to live his dreams will be inspiring to anyone who knows what it is like to harbor an impossible dream See this mov
    29	██████ was obviously working with a low budget here & it shows
    30	██████ Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side.
    31	are alternately humorous and annoying, and ████████████████████ has a nothing role as a put-upon wife (and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong).
    32	The adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often awkward it was a bad move to base the film on █████████████████ bowdlerised Broadway version, but at least his words were singable, unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness.
    33	But Tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by ██████████████.
    34	Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel Gélin) on a bus.The next day this man is murdered, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; an assassination will take place in London.The crooks kidnap the couple's son Hank (█████████████████) making sure Ben won't reveal their plan to anybody.Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) is a very intense thriller.The acting is superb as it always is in Hitchcok's films.James Stewart is marvelous.Doris Day is a delightful person and actress and she gets to show her singing talents as well.The song Que Sera, Sera has an important part in the movie.This movie is a movie of many classic scenes.In the final scenes at the Albert Hall, done without dialogue, you can barely blink your eyes.This movie is fifty years old now.Time hasn't decreased its power in any way.
    35	███████'s life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write.
    36	They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and █████'s sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life. A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman.
    37	This film tries so hard to be it all that it becomes a walking clich especially the scene in which ███████ hands Arn her necklace is so incredibly cheesy, it hurts.
    38	I have seen all the film interpretations of Hamlet, from Sir Lawrence Olivier to ██████████ (gasp). Derek Jacobi captures the true essence of the character, from the beginning to the brutal climax. Superb acting all around. This one should not be missed.
    39	It will be the death of ███████████████" Fascinating study on changing an image.
    40	Whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level, caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male-prostitute, ██████████ creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco.
    41	As usual, ██████████████ put in another relaxed and realistic performance.
    42	I have watched every version of this play that I can think of, including several on the stage, and Sir ███████████ is absolutely the best Hamlet I have ever seen!
    43	Its a helluva a cast too, check out how heavy ███████████ is.
    44	Usually, █████ was relegated to supporting roles but here he is what helps carry this very limp film.
    45	Same with the scene when █████████ finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side.
    46	I still think ███████ is brilliant and much better than the US film that was based on this drama.
    47	I have to admit that █████████ is one of a kind, you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence. A Chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience, the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of Zu Mountain and this is what he displayed.
    48	The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch █████████████'s soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting.
    49	No doubt, when Madonna and ███████████ married, it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers. If you've been through the ordeal of watching "Swept Away," then you know at that level it was a match made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "octress" as she might have pronounced it in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. And that's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen: that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience. If there's any justice in this universe, she just blew her last chance.
    50	A great gangster film.██████████ has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son camaraderie.Brilliant star-cast leading with Tom Hanks(Michael Sullivan) has done a terrific job.Great acting by him again.He is an acting legend.Great acting too from Paul Newman,Jude Law and Daniel Craig.Casting is just too good.The plot is quite good.You will enjoy the movie.A great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's.Set in the 1930's,this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era.Soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie.A great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son.Way underrated for my liking.Deserved a fully deserved 10.
    51	The collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day Mr █████ signed up for this one.
    52	And since ████ delivered so poorly in this respect, the movie never really had a chance.
    53	To this day, the most moving moment I can ever remember in the theatre occurred when █████ sang "These are my Friends."
    54	It chronicles , █████████(the character played by Muni) and how he works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started.
    55	The mentor this time is played perfectly by █████████████; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives.
    56	It's ███████████████████' Walken, doing a movie based on a fairy tale, and he sings and dances.
    57	I'll go so far as to put it up there with ███ and The Aviator.
    58	██████ Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed.
    59	This is a great film. From reading other reviews, I can see that I'm not the only one who shed a tear. ██████████████ acted with such skill and conviction, she made the ending heartfelt and memorable. In the hands of a lesser actress, her last scene would have seemed trite and corny.
    60	More than that, I was offended that I was led to believe that I was going to see an actually good movie, which █████████ is not.I couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie.
    61	Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and ██████████████ are all offspring of big-time film or TV people; no doubt, they will all want to direct some day, if they aren't already.
    62	Starring two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in ██████████ and Brad Pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience.
    63	█████████████ and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake
    64	On the outside, this film is better because of █████████████████ (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version.
    65	The scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for French intelligence can't even be described, and we won't even mention ████'s romantic scenes with a female.
    66	An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as █████████████'s voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.
    67	███████ went on to become the 1 box office star in the World although not 1 in the USA, herein playing a street punk rather than crime fighter.
    68	You'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film, as ████ hisses at a rat, Reno poses, and the call of the caribou goes out.
    69	███████████████ is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his few "I'm here strictly for the money" performances
    70	Also fantastic are the young actors ████████████████████ and Milton Davis Jr.
    71	The main draw to this one was to see ████████████ (Wonder Woman) out of that curve hugging outfit with her chest free to grace the screen.
    72	Hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give ██████████ credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be
    73	I enjoyed the movie and ██████████████ performance immensely. It's the kind of movie I can show my family and has an example of a young woman placed in extraordinary circumstances finding the courage to do the right thing in the face of extreme danger.
    74	S. ████████████████ brings the character to life beautifully, and the other cast members are do the same.
    75	This movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional Indian values which are being replaced by western ones. Its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around. Shahid Kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with ██████████ who is also very Desi and she also acts pretty well... The genre of the movie is the same as HAHK and such movies deserve to be made in India for the revival of old traditional values... The movies doesn't get 10 as it isn't very good at music which counts a lot in every movie,besides this it is flawless....
    76	I always thought of her as more matronly, but then surely that's a result of her roles in Sound of Music and ████████████.
    77	Kimberly, desperately wanting out on the puff news, sees the fight for truth is more important than boosting her career; constantly pushed by Richard, never wanted to be silenced demanding the public be told of the accident. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas and ███████████ are simply flawless.
    78	Dr. Ben McKenna (James ███████) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel Gélin) on a bus.The next day this man is murdered, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; an assassination will take place in London.The crooks kidnap the couple's son Hank (Christopher Olsen) making sure Ben won't reveal their plan to anybody.Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) is a very intense thriller.The acting is superb as it always is in Hitchcok's films.This movie is a movie of many classic scenes.In the final scenes at the Albert Hall, done without dialogue, you can barely blink your eyes.This movie is fifty years old now.Time hasn't decreased its power in any way.
    79	The only original bit was the Brighton location for gangsters. It is certainly no "Lock Stock etc......." ██████ was likeable in "Sliding Doors".
    80	I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was terrible, the title has nothing to do with the movie, the lead is a girl who tries to be █████████████.
    81	The 1971 version also includes more of the key lines and scenes from the book, including especially the key scene in the field where Anne overhears Wentworth talking to Louisa (or is it █████████?)
    82	How's that? █████████ has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least he did have with Europa. To me the whole film was like an experience even if I did see it on a small television screen.
    83	I gained an incredible amount of respect for █████████ as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny. I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress
    84	And I missed the fact that ███████████████ had an uncredited, non-speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene.  I was saddened to find out that the director and co-writer, Kayo Hatta, died in an accidental drowning in 2005.  There are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience: "Gaijin" about the immigrant cane workers in Brazil (many of them Japanese) in the same time period; and "Sugar Cane Alley" about the cane plantation experience in Africa.
    85	Strangely, this fact comes out only toward the very end, when Sally's brother █████ is understandbly furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying Jefferson's child.
    86	Once again ███████████ has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary.
    87	And ██████████, you can do better, so please, do!"
    88	█████████████ was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease, it was hard to tell the man was even acting.
    89	This excellent movie starring ████████████████████ is long overdue for release in DVD form, the same can be said for her earlier, also excellent movie.
    90	River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American screen writer ███████████ .
    91	According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes which is about Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy, and Randolph Scott, the author says that ███████████ was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost.
    92	Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, ██████████ is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10
    93	This fanciful horror flick has ███████ Price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another.
    94	His comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta rap, including ███████ who sampled him on his groundbreaking 1992 album "The Chronic"."
    95	██████ has a bigger role as a babysitter.
    96	█████████ is equally blase when told that Sally is carrying his child, and patronizingly tells her that she'd be far better off under his protection than free and living in France with her brother.
    97	He is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between █████████ and Bernanos.
    98	Starting with a "My Name is ███" like scene in Alcoholics Anonymous tBM careers into a mad spiral of infidelity, double standards and clandestine affairs but what do you expect from a family of lawyers?
    99	I was very impressed with with this film which was directed by (█████████████)
   100	Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel Gélin) on a bus.The next day this man is murdered, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; an assassination will take place in London.The crooks kidnap the couple's son Hank (Christopher Olsen) making sure Ben won't reveal their plan to anybody.Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) is a very intense thriller.The acting is superb as it always is in Hitchcok's films.James Stewart is marvelous.Doris Day is a delightful person and actress and she gets to show her singing talents as well.The song Que Sera, Sera has an important part in the movie.This movie is a movie of many classic scenes.In the final scenes at the ███████████, done without dialogue, you can barely blink your eyes.This movie is fifty years old now.Time hasn't decreased its power in any way.
   101	My main problem with the film is that it goes on too long. Other then that, it's pretty good. █████████ plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a servant girl who gets married to Muni. They live with Muni's father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad.
   102	Surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.. ███████████ gives a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go.
   103	The biggest reason I had to see this movie was that it stars ███████████, an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress. Time travel movies usually don't interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and creepy. It didn't rely on outrageous special effects and it didn't focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused. This was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all.
   104	The direction, music, and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by ███████████████, III.
   105	Tone/Neal/Welles are only a few -and this includes a butchered film called "The Lady From Shanghai"..."Lady From Shanghai" took two years to be released, thanks to extensive re-editing -and all because Columbia president ██████████ couldn't understand the story.
   106	The director only manages to introduce ███████'s dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution
   107	A tough sell: British playwright ██████████████ adapts his autobiographical stage drama.
   108	But while staying true to almost every aspect, ██████'s acting made it believable.
   109	A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this This is, however the first time I have been compelled to write a review of one... Put simply this is probably the worst film I have ever seen! Even worse then Boggy Creek II! The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when ████████ stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish. The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
   110	This film does for Infantry what ████████ did for Submariners.
   111	For example, when Kenny (███████████) asks Ginger (Ian Hart) why he does "it", Ginger can't come up with a morally acceptable answer.
   112	This is a pale imitation of 'Officer and a Gentleman.' There is NO chemistry between ███████ and the unknown woman who plays his love interest.
   113	You will come away with a new appreciation for ███████████ if you do.
   114	█████ has given the movie a nice score.
   115	███████'s character in "The Waterboy" was annoying but the film was still funny if you're in the right mood.
   116	Uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) supplies Leopold with a job in the big Zentropa train corporation, but soon Leopold falls in love with Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa); daughter of Zentropa owner ████████████ (Jørgen Reenberg).
   117	the monsters are cheap ripoffs of the Alien creatures but were done by EFX genius ██████████
   118	I was eight years old when I first saw this movie on the big screen in 1942. It was my first color movie and the scenes with the giant octopus gave me nightmares for a long time after. Today I still enjoy the film for its beautiful color photography, exciting sea scenes and fine performances from Ray Milland and ██████████. Wayne is unjustly accused of causing his ship to sink for profit. The story unfolds as he tries to clear his name .Paulette Goddard provides the love interest. The film never drags,whether on land or at sea where some of the most exciting action takes place.The underwater scenes,especially the finale ,are memorable. Supporting cast, score and special effects are all top notch.DeMille directs in his usual showman style. A fine effort from all concerned.
   119	I had completely forgotten about this late night movie show until I came across a reference to it on another IMDb page. And what a great show it was, with wonderful bottom-of-the-barrel flicks interspersed with the occasional legit movie, and hosted by various funny folks like █████████████████, Such fond memories. The topic of female nudity -- a frequent occurrence in many of the flicks shown -- and how this was handled makes for some very funny reading here, and I remember that sort of thing vividly. Today, the station would simply optically obscure what it doesn't want us to see, instead of making ridiculous and downright damaging edits. Many of these films may never be seen again, sad to say. I agree with those who suggest watching G4, which runs some pretty awful and hilarious flicks from time to time. But it's not and never will be "USA Up All Night." That was one of a kind.
   120	██████████████'s Europa is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American coming to post-World War II Europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery.
   121	"In Cold Blood", adapted by director Richard Brooks from █████████████'s famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals.
   122	On the island already are ████████████████ and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend.
   123	Also starring █████████████.
   124	Filmed for Monogram, ███████████ is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community.
   125	I understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found ████████████ role crucial and penetrating and then ?????
   126	███████████████'s 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty
   127	Keep an eye out for good performances by ████████████████ as Evelyn's unsympathetic landlady, Jim Backus as a shifty club owner, and Art Smith as Korvin's fence.A real sleeper in the noir category, don't miss it if broadcast.
   128	Im not a big ████████████ fan but i have to admit i liked this film.It was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy,i don't know were to classify this film its a bit SF and a bit horror slash thriller.I saw this at about 2.00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it.
   129	After ███████ learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him. It's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films.
   130	Would you like to know why French and Italians love/hate each others? Would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime? So, go to watch Virzi's film (in original language, of course) and you can look at a wonderful Monica Bellucci who finally speaks her native language from Città di Castello (Umbria, just at the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters speaking Livornese (lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel Auteuil definitely in his shoes with ████████. A lot of fun, a real fresco of the Elba Island landscape, and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant (good for all times).
   131	This excellent movie starring ████████████████████ is long overdue for release in DVD form, the same can be said for her earlier, also excellent movie.
   132	A killer named ███████████████, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning.
   133	eXistenZ is simply █████████████████ best movie.
   134	Haines makes an incredible impression, when he joins ██████ for a commissary meal - tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table.
   135	Supporting cast includes ██████████████, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor and Jay Novello.
   136	Nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than ██████ herself.
   137	███ is better by a hair width, she is always cool
   138	The characters lack depth and they seem to be incredibly selfish nd generally un-likable people.  To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a Casino" In my opinion thats way to generous, ████████ was way better, and much more realistic.
   139	I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director █████████'s commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.
   140	This game is not exactly the best N64 game ever. Sure, it's good, but only when there's 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game are levels where you have to save Natalya, so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels, and that gets quite boring. The graphics don't exactly reach the level of ███████████ 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you're talking a great multiplayer in a 1st-person shooter, you'll have to go with Perfect Dark. At least you can play "multiplayer" by yourself.
   141	This is one excellent ██████████ movie.
   142	The only complaint is the fact that ████████████ can't act!
   143	██████████████, well what else needs to be said
   144	█████████ is very funny as 'Finkel', Byers' ever-so English butler.
   145	A great gangster film.Sam Mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son camaraderie.Brilliant star-cast leading with Tom Hanks(Michael Sullivan) has done a terrific job.Great acting by him again.He is an acting legend.Great acting too from Paul Newman,████████ and Daniel Craig.Casting is just too good.The plot is quite good.You will enjoy the movie.A great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's.Set in the 1930's,this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era.Soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie.A great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son.Way underrated for my liking.Deserved a fully deserved 10.
   146	Brooklyn nightclub dancer played by █████████████ specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine.
   147	However, █████████████ is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect.
   148	The short film which got Gaspar Noe on the movie map, introducing us to his horrific, but thoroughly interesting character The Butcher, played brilliantly by ██████████████.
   149	It's sad that anybody watching might actually think they were ██████'s own.
   150	The curse of ███████ lives on.
   151	how the heck did ██████ get out of cabs without being seen?
   152	Another encounter involves the brilliant █████████████ as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.
   153	The Buddy Holly Story is a great biography with a super performance from ██████████. Busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job.
   154	While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments ███████ well.
   155	Even a bad █████████████ Musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! In fact it's quite entertaining. Actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae
   156	In the film "Brokedown Palace," directed by ███████████████, two best friends, Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to Hawaii, but hear that Bangkok, Thailand, is much more fun.
   157	Plus, this film wallows in late 1970s chic, which works for some (█████████████'s "The Virgin Suicides" comes to mind) but not for this director.
   158	After you see Vertigo, then watch Bell, Book and Candle, made within months of each other. My second favorite █████████ film, with Picnic, coming in as third. All three performances are great, Vertigo, being the best, of all. They came to my nowhere Kansas Prairie town, near by, at Salina, Kansas in the 50s, to film, Picnic.  Bell, Book and Candle's musical score, I believe is one of Alex North's. Perfect for this bit of comedy. After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, did this comedy, how amusing to note the dramatic contrast. Worth your time, if you like Kim Novak. The Greta Garbo of my youth.
   159	Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and ███████████████
   160	And then later it's revealed that the young ladies don't even have to be brides for the procedure to work so why would ██████ keep kidnapping brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines
   161	Here, he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean-ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run --played by former pretty-boy Weller-- who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. Current pretty-boy ███████████████ --possibly more handsome than his dad-- is featured as Weller's arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving.
   162	But to be a little more precise I do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be Eventhough the actors (famous to semi-famous) didn't do a very great job Directors fault? Could be the script as well hard for me to say? Anyway, if you are after a lot of cool guns and action this is not the movie for you but they do run around with a lot of ww2 vintage guns Sort of fun :) Well I guess I could say more but it just doesn't feel as if it's worth it If you are desperate enough or a ███████ freak see it otherwise don't! Live well and prosper
   163	At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (██████████████?)
   164	One of My favorite Stooges shorts with █████ is none other than Brideless Groom!
   165	I'm not a ███████████ fan because most of his movies suck, but TLKG hits its mark time after time.
   166	About time some one made a good young British comedy that didn't star ██████████ or forty something's. The story is a morality tale but never preachy, throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'
   167	Look for the first appearance of ███████████ as Young Bull.
   168	Wow, another █████████████ hero movie.
   169	I hope Robert Redford continues to make more films like this. Hillerman's books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the Southwest his stories hit home! ████ Beach is a highly under rated and under used actor. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks that your Mel Gibson's are cool! Many movie goer's today want to see films that make you think. I have seen all of the Redford/Hillerman series. They are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. I'm hoping that if enough people write to Robert Redford he may decide to make a few more! Thank you Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great entertainment! If anyone get's a chance to read Tony Hillerman's latest book do so! It's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at every view site and feel the setting of Hillerman's books. Amazing experience.
   170	█████████████, suddenly gets a yen for adoption.
   171	████████████████ invented any kind of thriller you could think of:he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him
   172	█████ does Butch one better by blowing them all to pieces.
   173	She's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film. ████: The director.
   174	when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s, I noticed the music was by ██████████, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it.
   175	Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, ██████████████████████ are all here, all enormous and all very strong.
   176	MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific, sadly underrated █████████████.
   177	when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s, I noticed the music was by ██████████, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it.
   178	Dear Readers, With High Expectations, Human Beings leave █████ to begin a new life in Space Colonies.
   179	The speaker cited ██████ as an example for spontaneity.
   180	It is hilarious to see █████████████ do spoofs on all his previous Mob characters. To see him crying after all the tough guys he has played it is really funny. Billy Crystal is excellent as his therapist who is trying to help him through his anxiety issues. I want to see it again so I can hear all the lines I missed the first time because I was laughing so hard. Rating 10
   181	If it's got ████████████████ in it, it's definitely going to be bad.
   182	██████ died before the movie was completed and it was canned.
   183	A killer named ███████████████, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning.
   184	although as far as I can tell, █████████████ wife is in it
   185	Co-scripted by ███████████████ from, arguably, Donald E. Westlake's best and hardest to find novel
   186	But give, and you shall receive, as ████████████████ monumental production demonstrates
   187	And it all leads up to one last, inexplicable showdown between the two men. Strange that there's yet another film where █████ has peaks and valleys here, sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it.
   188	I was JUST about to turn the movie off because of █████████████ accent, when it made it to the sex scene, so I thought it might get better, well it did not.
   189	█████████████ plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer.
   190	So if this will not be a real reviveing for the Italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for █████████████████ after his 'Respiro' another definitive beautiful film
   191	The plot that drives what little non-archival footage there is revolves around ████████' character, a mid twenties student in anthropology.
   192	And Jason Connery's so cute, as the shy and awkward miller's son, █████, who falls in love with beautiful and the bold Princess Vera.
   193	OK, so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung (though Walken and ██████, particularly Walken, sounded pretty good).
   194	I loved watching ██████ in this role thinking about what the future held for him.
   195	But overall, this game is the best ██████████ experience so far.
   196	A more recent film, █████████████████, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction.
   197	This game is not exactly the best N64 game ever. Sure, it's good, but only when there's 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game are levels where you have to save ███████, so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels, and that gets quite boring. The graphics don't exactly reach the level of Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you're talking a great multiplayer in a 1st-person shooter, you'll have to go with Perfect Dark. At least you can play "multiplayer" by yourself.
   198	██████████████ represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the box-office, and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies, mafia score-settling and World War II battles, Verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It's an oddly static film, taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms, containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence. Montand gives a good performance, if somewhat dry, and he is well supported by the other actors. I couldn't help wondering what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story, on the basis of Z (the Lambrakis assassination) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
   199	This is ten times better than "Who Wants To BE A Super Model"" on Bravo I think it is more true to the business, ████ is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model.
   200	I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of █████████████ (and not just since Titanic, I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..).
